Console Christmas Tree

This program was written for fun to simply draw a Christmas Tree on the console.

Compiling:

make

Running:

./xmastree

Running the command with no arguments as provided above will draw a tree with a
length of 7.

./xmastree <length>

Running the command with a length will draw the tree to the specified length.
The length must range between 5-31. It must step up by two starting from 5. For
example 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ... 31.

Optional Debug Mode:

You can also compile in debug mode. When compiling in this mode, the system will
 print out some of the coordinates and offset values that will be used to print 
the tree to screen.

To build in debug mode, simply run:

make debug
